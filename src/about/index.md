Control-C is a tech podcast where Chris Becker and Jeff Uthaichai talk about
technology, beer, and anything else on their mind. Chris and Jeff grew up around
computers and have a very diverse background, experience, and set of skills.
They agree on many things but disagree on others. (see
[git history](https://github.com/jeffu/controlc.dev/commits/master) for oxford
comma disagreements)

This podcast is conversational. We'll talk about technology, things we like to
build, and our thoughts on everything. It's not about being correct, it's about
learning all we can.
